# cisco_roomos_macros
These are either macros I'm using on my Cisco Room Kit in the home office, or samples/playing around. Mostly to have a backup, but also to share my usecases.

## slidelayout_automator
Using a (single screen) room device next to a laptop with a Webex Teams client, you can easily optimize the layout, offloading the content to the client to spend more screen real estate on the video call.
This code monitors presentation start, and will automatically minimize incoming presentation once started (by a far end user).
